# E-commerce

Group project (4 teammates) | 6 weeks | Symfony, React.js

My teammates and I have created a site for on-line sales of high-tech products.
It was a project in real-life conditions, we had to use the Agile methodology.

We had to build the client side and server side.
My main tasks were to create the user/customer profile and the user update feature via the admin panel.
